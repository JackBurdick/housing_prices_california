## Project Information
The included [`./explore_housing_data.ipynb`](https://github.com/JackBurdick/housing_prices_california/blob/master/explore_housing_data.ipynb) provides a commented walk though of our pipeline and model creation and evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Conda environments have been included and can be found in the `./environments` directory for both windows and mac/linux

## Future Improvements:
1. The main `.ipynb` should be cleaned up and comments need to be improved.
